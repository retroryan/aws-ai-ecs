# Context Retention Issues in AWS Strands Weather Agent

## Summary

The AWS Strands Weather Agent demos reveal significant context retention issues in multi-turn conversations. While individual queries work perfectly, the agent fails to maintain conversation context across turns, leading to degraded user experience in multi-turn scenarios.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Complete Context Loss Between Turns**

**Problem**: The agent does not retain information from previous turns in the conversation.

**Evidence from Demo Results**:

**Turn 1**: "What's the weather like in Seattle?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent provides Seattle weather
- ✅ **Actual**: Works correctly - provides detailed Seattle weather

**Turn 2**: "How does it compare to Portland?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent compares Portland to Seattle (from previous context)
- ❌ **Actual**: Agent asks for clarification about which Portland and what to compare it to
- **Error**: "I don't have a previous context to compare with"

**Turn 3**: "Which city would be better for outdoor activities this weekend?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent compares Seattle vs Portland for outdoor activities
- ❌ **Actual**: Agent asks which cities to compare
- **Error**: "I need some specific cities to compare"

### 2. **Context Switching Demo Failures**

**Turn 1**: "Tell me about the weather in Miami and Phoenix"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent provides weather for both cities
- ✅ **Actual**: Works correctly - detailed weather for both cities

**Turn 2**: "I'm planning to grow citrus fruits. Which location is better?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent analyzes Miami vs Phoenix for citrus growing
- ❌ **Actual**: Agent asks for specific locations to compare
- **Error**: "I'll need specific locations to compare"

**Turn 3**: "What about Denver? How's the weather there?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent provides Denver weather
- ✅ **Actual**: Works correctly - provides Denver weather

**Turn 4**: "Can I grow citrus there too?"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent analyzes Denver for citrus growing (referencing previous citrus question)
- ❌ **Actual**: Agent asks which location is being referenced
- **Error**: "I don't have the previous context about the location"

**Turn 5**: "Give me a summary of all three cities for both weather and agriculture"
- ✅ **Expected**: Agent summarizes Miami, Phoenix, and Denver for weather and agriculture
- ❌ **Actual**: Agent asks which three cities
- **Error**: "No specific cities were mentioned in your request"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **No Session Management**: Each query is processed independently without conversation history
2. **Stateless Agent Calls**: The `agent.query()` method doesn't maintain state between calls
3. **Missing Conversation Context**: No mechanism to pass previous conversation turns to the agent

### Technical Root Cause

In `weather_agent/mcp_agent.py`, line 203:

```python
# Process query
response = agent(message)
```

The agent is called with only the current message, without any conversation history or session context.

## Testing Context Retention

### Test Cases

Create these test scenarios to validate context retention:

#### Test 1: Basic Context Reference
```
Turn 1: "What's the weather in Chicago?"
Turn 2: "How about New York?" 
Expected: Agent provides New York weather without asking for clarification
```

#### Test 2: Comparison Context
```
Turn 1: "Weather in Miami and Denver"
Turn 2: "Which is better for outdoor activities?"
Expected: Agent compares Miami vs Denver for outdoor activities
```

#### Test 3: Topic Context Switching
```
Turn 1: "Weather in Seattle"
Turn 2: "Is it good for planting tomatoes?"
Expected: Agent analyzes Seattle's weather for tomato planting
```

#### Test 4: Multi-Location Context
```
Turn 1: "Compare Boston, Atlanta, and Phoenix"
Turn 2: "Which has the best agriculture conditions?"
Turn 3: "What about historical temperatures for the warmest one?"
Expected: Agent maintains all three cities and identifies which is warmest
```

### Automated Testing

```python
async def test_context_retention():
    agent = MCPWeatherAgent()
    session_id = "test_session_1"
    
    # Turn 1
    response1 = await agent.query("What's the weather in Seattle?", session_id)
    
    # Turn 2 - should reference Seattle from previous turn
    response2 = await agent.query("How does it compare to Portland?", session_id)
    
    # Validate that response2 contains comparison between Seattle and Portland
    assert "Seattle" in response2 and "Portland" in response2
```

## What Needs to be Fixed

### 1. Implement Session Management

**Required Changes**:

1. **Add conversation history to agent calls**:
   ```python
   # In _process_with_clients_sync method
   agent = Agent(
       model=self.bedrock_model,
       tools=all_tools,
       system_prompt=self._get_system_prompt(),
       max_parallel_tools=2,
       conversation_history=self._get_conversation_history(session_id)  # ADD THIS
   )
   ```

2. **Store conversation history per session**:
   ```python
   class MCPWeatherAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.conversations = {}  # session_id -> [messages]
   
       def _store_turn(self, session_id, user_message, agent_response):
           if session_id not in self.conversations:
               self.conversations[session_id] = []
           self.conversations[session_id].append({
               "user": user_message,
               "assistant": agent_response
           })
   ```

3. **Update query method to use session_id**:
   ```python
   async def query(self, message: str, session_id: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
       if session_id is None:
           session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
       
       # Get conversation history
       history = self._get_conversation_history(session_id)
       
       # Process with context
       response = await self._process_with_context(message, history, session_id)
       
       # Store this turn
       self._store_turn(session_id, message, response)
       
       return response
   ```

### 2. Context-Aware System Prompt

**Enhanced System Prompt**:
```
You are a helpful weather and agricultural assistant. You maintain context across conversations.

CONTEXT HANDLING:
- Remember locations, topics, and questions from previous turns in the conversation
- When users say "it", "there", "that city", etc., refer to the most recent relevant location
- For comparison questions like "how does it compare", use the most recent location as reference
- Maintain agricultural and weather topics across turns

Previous conversation context will be provided to help you maintain continuity.
```

### 3. Demo Fixes

**Update demo_scenarios.py**:
```python
async def run_mcp_multi_turn_demo(structured: bool = False):
    # Use consistent session_id for all turns
    session_id = "multi_turn_demo_session"
    
    for turn in conversation_turns:
        # Pass session_id to maintain context
        response = await agent.query(turn['query'], session_id=session_id)
```

### 4. Structured Output Context

**For structured queries**, update `query_structured`:
```python
async def query_structured(self, message: str, session_id: Optional[str] = None) -> WeatherQueryResponse:
    # Include conversation history in structured output
    history = self._get_conversation_history(session_id) if session_id else []
    
    # Pass context to structured output processing
    response = await self._process_structured_query_with_context(message, clients, history)
```

```

## Code Cleanup Issues

### Duplicate and Inconsistent Files

#### 1. **Multiple API Entry Points**
**Files**:
- `/api.py` (project root)
- `/weather_agent/api_main.py`

**Issue**: Two nearly identical FastAPI implementations
**Solution**: 
- Keep `/api.py` as the main API server (referenced in docker-compose.yml)
- Remove `/weather_agent/api_main.py` (duplicate with different import paths)

#### 2. **Duplicate Model Definitions**
**Files**:
- `/weather_agent/models.py` (old models)
- `/weather_agent/models/structured_responses.py` (current models)

**Issue**: The old `models.py` contains outdated models that overlap with the structured response models
**Solution**:
- Remove `/weather_agent/models.py` entirely
- Ensure all imports reference `/weather_agent/models/structured_responses.py`

#### 3. **Test File Cleanup**
**Files**:
- `/weather_agent/simple_test.py` (basic test with import issues)
- `/weather_agent/test_mcp_agent.py` (incomplete test)

**Issue**: Duplicate test files with import problems
**Solution**:
- Remove `/weather_agent/simple_test.py` (has incorrect imports)
- Consolidate testing in `/tests/` directory

#### 4. **System Prompt Loading Issues**

**Current Problem**: System prompts are stored in project root but loaded inconsistently

**Current Files**:
- `/system_prompt.txt` (main prompt)
- `/system_prompt_agriculture.txt` (specialized prompt)
- `/system_prompt_simple.txt` (simplified prompt)

**Current Loading Logic**: In `mcp_agent.py` lines 106-109:
```python
prompt_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / self.system_prompt_file
```

**Issues**:
1. Hardcoded path resolution that breaks in different execution contexts
2. System prompts should be co-located with the weather_agent code, not in project root
3. No validation of which prompt file is actually loaded
4. Fallback prompt is hardcoded in Python code instead of a file

**Required Fix**: 
- Move system prompt files to `/weather_agent/prompts/`
- Create dedicated prompt loading class
- Add validation and better error handling
- Make prompt selection configurable via environment variables

### Code Architecture Issues

#### 1. **Import Path Inconsistencies**
**Issues**:
- Relative imports break when modules are run directly
- Some files import `from mcp_agent` others use `from .mcp_agent`
- Demo files have import path problems

**Solutions**:
- Standardize on absolute imports from project root
- Fix all relative imports in demo files
- Add proper `__init__.py` files for package structure

#### 2. **Unused Legacy Code**
**Files to Remove**:
- `/weather_agent/models.py` (superseded by structured_responses)
- `/weather_agent/simple_test.py` (superseded by proper tests)
- Any old query classification code (if structured output replaces it)

#### 3. **Configuration Management**
**Issue**: Environment variables and configuration scattered across multiple files
**Solution**: Create centralized configuration management

## System Prompt Loading Fix

### Current Implementation Issues

**In `mcp_agent.py`**:
```python
def _get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    prompt_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / self.system_prompt_file
    # This breaks when the module is imported from different locations
```

### Required Changes

#### 1. **Move Prompts to weather_agent Directory**
```
weather_agent/
├── prompts/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── default.txt
│   ├── agriculture.txt
│   └── simple.txt
```

#### 2. **Create Prompt Manager**
```python
# weather_agent/prompt_manager.py
class PromptManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompts_dir = Path(__file__).parent / "prompts"
    
    def get_prompt(self, prompt_name: str = "default") -> str:
        prompt_file = self.prompts_dir / f"{prompt_name}.txt"
        if prompt_file.exists():
            return prompt_file.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
        return self._get_fallback_prompt()
```

#### 3. **Environment Variable Control**
```python
# Allow prompt selection via environment
SYSTEM_PROMPT = os.getenv("SYSTEM_PROMPT", "default")  # default, agriculture, simple
```

#### 4. **Update mcp_agent.py**
```python
def __init__(self, prompt_type: Optional[str] = None):
    self.prompt_manager = PromptManager()
    self.prompt_type = prompt_type or os.getenv("SYSTEM_PROMPT", "default")

def _get_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    return self.prompt_manager.get_prompt(self.prompt_type)
```
