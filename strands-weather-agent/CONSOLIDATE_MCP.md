# MCP Server Consolidation Status

## Goal
**CRITICAL**: Complete consolidation of three separate MCP servers (forecast, historical, agricultural) into a single unified weather server. This is a CLEAN and COMPLETE update with NO migration or compatibility layers. All references to the old three-server architecture must be removed and replaced with the single server pattern.

## Pattern Reference
Following the successful pattern from `/Users/ryanknight/projects/temporal/durable-ai-agent` which demonstrates:
- Single MCP server with multiple tools
- Unified Pydantic models in a central location
- Clean separation of concerns with utility modules
- Simplified Docker and deployment configuration

## ✅ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE

### Summary of Changes

1. **Created Unified Weather Server**
   - `mcp_servers/weather_server.py` - Single server with all three tools
   - Runs on port 7778 (same as old forecast server)
   - Provides: `get_weather_forecast`, `get_historical_weather`, `get_agricultural_conditions`

2. **Updated Agent Configuration**
   - `weather_agent/mcp_agent.py` - Now uses single `MCP_SERVER_URL` environment variable
   - Simplified connectivity testing for single server
   - Removed references to multiple server URLs

3. **Updated Docker Configuration**
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Single `weather-server` container instead of three
   - `docker/Dockerfile.weather` - New unified Dockerfile
   - Simplified service dependencies

4. **Updated Scripts**
   - `scripts/start_server.sh` - Starts single server
   - `scripts/stop_server.sh` - Stops single server
   - `scripts/test_docker.sh` - Tests single server health endpoint

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - `CLAUDE.md` - All references updated to single server architecture
   - `.env.example` files - Updated to use `MCP_SERVER_URL`

6. **Removed Old Files**
   - Deleted `mcp_servers/forecast_server.py`
   - Deleted `mcp_servers/historical_server.py`
   - Deleted `mcp_servers/agricultural_server.py`
   - Deleted `docker/Dockerfile.forecast`
   - Deleted `docker/Dockerfile.historical`
   - Deleted `docker/Dockerfile.agricultural`

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (Three Servers)
```
weather-agent → forecast-server:7778    → get_weather_forecast
             → historical-server:7779   → get_historical_weather
             → agricultural-server:7780 → get_agricultural_conditions
```

### After (Single Server)
```
weather-agent → weather-server:7778 → get_weather_forecast
                                   → get_historical_weather
                                   → get_agricultural_conditions
```

## Environment Variable Changes

### Old
```bash
MCP_FORECAST_URL=http://localhost:7778/mcp
MCP_HISTORICAL_URL=http://localhost:7779/mcp
MCP_AGRICULTURAL_URL=http://localhost:7780/mcp
```

### New
```bash
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:7778/mcp
```

## Testing the New Architecture

### Local Testing
```bash
# Start the unified server
./scripts/start_server.sh

# Test the server
curl http://localhost:7778/health

# Run the agent
python main.py
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
# Start with Docker
./scripts/start_docker.sh

# Test the services
./scripts/test_docker.sh
```

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simplified Architecture** - One server to manage instead of three
2. **Reduced Resource Usage** - Single process, single port
3. **Easier Deployment** - One container in Docker/ECS
4. **Simplified Configuration** - Single URL to configure
5. **Better Maintainability** - All weather tools in one place

## No Migration Needed

This was a complete replacement with no compatibility layers:
- All old server files removed
- All configuration updated
- No backward compatibility maintained
- Clean, single-server architecture throughout
