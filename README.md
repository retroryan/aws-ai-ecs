# AWS AI ECS - The New Era of Software Development with AI Services on ECS + Bedrock

This repository demonstrates the future of software development: AI-powered applications running seamlessly on AWS ECS with Bedrock integration. Each project showcases how modern AI services can be containerized and deployed at scale, representing a paradigm shift in how we build intelligent applications.

## Overview

The repository contains three example projects that showcase the evolution of AI application development on AWS infrastructure. Each project demonstrates running AI Services on ECS + Bedrock, highlighting different levels of sophistication in the new era of model-driven development:

### 1. [Strands Weather Agent](./strands-weather-agent) ‚≠ê (Most Important Demo)
**The pinnacle demonstration of model-driven development** - this project showcases the true power of the new era of software development. Built with AWS Strands, it represents a paradigm shift where agents orchestrate complex workflows with minimal code:
- **Model-driven architecture**: Define what you want, let the agent figure out how to get it
- **Agent orchestration**: The agent automatically manages tool selection, execution, and data flow
- **Native MCP support**: Seamless integration with distributed tool servers
- **Minimal code, maximum capability**: Complete weather analysis system in just a few lines
- **Type-safe structured outputs**: Automatic response validation and formatting
- Shows how AWS Strands eliminates hundreds of lines of orchestration code

### 2. [Agent ECS Template](./agent-ecs-template)
A foundational template project for deploying agent-based AI applications to AWS ECS. This project demonstrates:
- Client-server architecture patterns for AI agents
- **Direct AWS Bedrock integration using boto3** for foundational model access
- Proper containerization of AI workloads
- Health monitoring and service management
- CloudFormation infrastructure as code

### 3. [Agriculture Agent ECS](./agriculture-agent-ecs)
A practical implementation of an AI-powered weather and agricultural data agent system. This project features:
- **LangGraph integration with AWS Bedrock** for orchestrating complex AI workflows
- Integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Real-world use case for agricultural data analysis
- Weather data processing and insights
- Production-ready deployment patterns

## Why This Repository?

Getting started with AWS Bedrock and deploying AI applications to production can be challenging. This repository addresses common pain points by providing:

- **Ready-to-Deploy Templates**: Pre-configured CloudFormation templates and deployment scripts
- **Best Practices**: Structured logging, health checks, and error handling patterns
- **Container Optimization**: Docker configurations optimized for AI workloads
- **Cost-Effective Architecture**: ECS deployment patterns that scale efficiently

## The New Era: From Manual Coding to Model-Driven Development

This repository showcases the evolution of AI application development, demonstrating how we're transitioning from traditional programming to model-driven architectures where AI agents orchestrate complex workflows autonomously.

### AWS Bedrock Integration Approaches

1. **Direct boto3 Integration** (Agent ECS Template)
   - Low-level control over Bedrock API calls
   - Traditional approach requiring manual orchestration
   - Good for understanding fundamentals

2. **LangGraph Framework** (Agriculture Agent ECS)
   - Graph-based orchestration of AI workflows
   - Requires explicit workflow definition
   - Step up from manual coding but still requires orchestration logic

3. **AWS Strands** (Strands Weather Agent) ‚≠ê
   - **The future of AI development**: Model-driven architecture
   - **Agent orchestrates everything**: No manual workflow coding needed
   - **Declarative programming**: Specify what you want, not how to get it
   - **Automatic tool discovery and execution**: The agent handles all complexity
   - **10x productivity gain**: Build in hours what used to take weeks

### Why Strands Represents the Paradigm Shift

Traditional development required hundreds of lines of code to coordinate API calls, handle responses, and manage state. With Strands, you simply declare your desired output structure, and the agent orchestrates all the necessary steps internally. This is the new era of software development - where developers focus on business logic while AI handles the implementation details.

**Example: The Power of Model-Driven Development**
```python
# Traditional: 200+ lines of orchestration code
# vs.
# Strands: Complete weather analysis in 4 lines
agent = Agent(name="weather-assistant", foundation_model_config={"model_id": model_id})
response = agent.structured_output(WeatherAnalysis, "Analyze weather for Chicago farming")
# The agent automatically orchestrates tool calls, data gathering, and response formatting
```

## Key Features

- üöÄ **Quick Start**: Get AI applications running on AWS ECS in minutes
